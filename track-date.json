The racetrack is nicknamed Old Hilltop after a small rise in the infield that became a favorite gathering place for thoroughbred trainers and race enthusiasts. Pimlico was owned by the Stronach Group from 2011 until 2024, when ownership transferred to the state-run Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority"
